tl;dr: We built an agent skill that teaches coding agents how to write production CUDA kernels. Then we pointed Claude and Codex at two real targets: a diffusers pipeline and a transformers model. The agents produced working kernels for both, with correct PyTorch bindings and benchmarks, end to end. Writing CUDA kernels that correctly integrate with transformers and diffusers is harder.
