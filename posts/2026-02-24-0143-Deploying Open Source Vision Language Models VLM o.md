Vision-Language Models (VLMs) mark a significant leap in AI by blending visual perception with semantic reasoning. Moving beyond traditional models constrained by fixed labels, VLMs utilize a joint embedding space to interpret and discuss complex, open-ended environments using natural language. The rapid evolution of reasoning accuracy and efficiency has made these models ideal for edge devices.
