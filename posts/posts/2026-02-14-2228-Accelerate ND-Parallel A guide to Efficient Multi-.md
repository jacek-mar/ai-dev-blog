Training large models across multiple GPUs can be challenging due to the complexities of different parallelism strategies. In Accelerate, together with Axolotl, we have integrated a quick and easy way to use any combination of parallelism strategies in your training script!
Here is how to add it to your training script:
We've also included a more comprehensive end-to-end training script in the Accelerate repo which demonstrates how to setup your dataloader, optimizer, and training loop, and how ...
