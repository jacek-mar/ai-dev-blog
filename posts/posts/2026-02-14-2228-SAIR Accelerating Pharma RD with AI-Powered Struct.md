This summer, SandboxAQ released the Structurally Augmented IC50 Repository (SAIR), the largest dataset of co-folded 3D protein-ligand structures paired with experimentally measured IC₅₀ labels, directly linking molecular structure to drug potency and overcoming a longstanding scarcity in training data. This dataset is now available on Hugging Face, and for the first time, researchers have open access to more than 5 million AI‑generated, high‑accuracy protein-ligand 3D structures, each paired wit...
