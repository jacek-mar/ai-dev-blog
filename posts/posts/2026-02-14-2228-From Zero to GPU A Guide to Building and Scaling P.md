Custom CUDA kernels give your models a serious performance edge, but building them for the real world can feel daunting. How do you move beyond a simple GPU function to create a robust, scalable system without getting bogged down by endless build times and dependency nightmares?
We created the kernel-builder library for this purpose. You can develop a custom kernel locally, and then build it for multiple architectures and make it available for the world to use.
In this guide we'll show you how t...
