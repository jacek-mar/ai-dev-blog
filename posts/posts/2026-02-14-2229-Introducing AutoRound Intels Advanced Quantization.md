As large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, deploying them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging. Quantization offers a solution by reducing model size and inference latency. Intel's AutoRound emerges as a cutting-edge quantization tool that balances accuracy, efficiency, and compatibility.
AutoRound is a weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) method developed by Intel.
