Modern search systems are increasingly designed to process heterogeneous document images that may contain text, tables, charts, figures, and other visual components. In this context, accurately retrieving relevant information across these diverse modalities is a central challenge. Multimodal embedding models built on top of foundational vision–language models (VLMs) map diverse content types into a shared representation space, enabling unified retrieval over text, images, and structured visual e...
