Vision Language Models (VLMs) are getting stronger, but aligning them to human preferences still matters. In TRL, we already showed how to post-train VLMs with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This time, we’re going further.
tl;dr Here’s what’s new in TRL:
These go beyond pairwise DPO, extracting richer signals from preference data and scaling better with modern VLMs.
We’ve also extended existing methods to support VLMs:
This enables more efficient and scala...
