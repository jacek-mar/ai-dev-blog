The status quo of AI chip usage, that was once almost entirely U.S.-based, is changing. China’s immense progress in open-weight AI development is now being met with rapid domestic AI chip development. In the past few months, highly performant open-weight AI models’ inference in China has started to be powered by chips such as Huawei’s Ascend and Cambricon, with some models starting to be trained using domestic chips.
There are two large implications for policymakers and AI researchers and develo...
