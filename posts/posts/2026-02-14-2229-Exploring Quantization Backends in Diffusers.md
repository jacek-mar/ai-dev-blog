Large diffusion models like Flux (a flow-based text-to-image generation model) can create stunning images, but their size can be a hurdle, demanding significant memory and compute resources. Quantization offers a powerful solution, shrinking these models to make them more accessible without drastically compromising performance. But the big question always is: can you actually tell the difference in the final image?
Before we dive into the technical details of how various quantization backends in...
