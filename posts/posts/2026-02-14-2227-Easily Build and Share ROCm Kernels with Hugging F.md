Custom kernels are the backbone of high-performance deep learning, enabling GPU operations tailored precisely to your workload; whether that’s image processing, tensor transformations, or other compute-heavy tasks. But compiling these kernels for the right architectures, wiring all the build flags, and integrating them cleanly into PyTorch extensions can quickly become a mess of CMake/Nix, compiler errors, and ABI issues, which is not fun.
