🧭 TL;DR — Why This Blogpost?
In this post, we:
Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robots to perform a wide range of tasks—from simple commands like “grasp the cube” to more complex activities like folding laundry or cleaning a table. These models aim to achieve generalization: the ability to perform tasks in novel settings, with unseen objects, and in varying conditions.
“The biggest challenge in robotics isn’t dexterity, but generalization—across physical, visua...
