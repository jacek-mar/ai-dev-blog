A hands-on guide to collecting data, training policies, and deploying autonomous medical robotics workflows on real hardware
Simulation has been a cornerstone in medical imaging to address the data gap. However, in healthcare robotics until now, it's often been too slow, siloed, or difficult to translate into real-world systems.
NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare, a developer framework for AI healthcare robotics, enables healthcare robotics developers in solving these challenges via offering integrated...
