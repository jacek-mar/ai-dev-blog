TL;DR of L2D, the world's largest self-driving dataset!
State-of-the art Vision Language Models and Large Language Models are trained on open-source
image-text corpora sourced from the internet, which spearheaded the recent acceleration of open-source AI. Despite these
breakthroughs, the adoption of end-to-end AI within the robotics and automotive community remains low, primarily due to a
lack of high quality, large scale multimodal datasets like OXE.
To unlock the potential for robotics AI, Yaa...
