Today Google releases a new and better family of multilingual vision-language encoders, SigLIP 2. The authors have extended the training objective of SigLIP (sigmoid loss) with additional objectives for improved semantic understanding, localization, and dense features.
SigLIP 2 models outperform the older SigLIP ones at all model scales in core capabilities, including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Langua...
