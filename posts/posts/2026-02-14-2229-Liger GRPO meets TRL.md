TL; DR
Liger supercharges TRL’s Group Relative Policy Optimization GRPO Trainer by slashing memory usage by 40% with zero drop in model quality. We also added support for FSDP and PEFT, making it easier than ever to scale GRPO across multiple GPUs.
Fine-tuning language models using reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial step in a model's training lifecycle for steering models towards desirable behaviours which are more complex than can be achieved through typical supervised fine-tuning.
