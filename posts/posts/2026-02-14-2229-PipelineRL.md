We are excited to open-source PipelineRL, an experimental RL implementation that tackles a fundamental challenge in large-scale Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: the trade-off between inference throughput and on-policy data collection. PipelineRL's key innovation is inflight weight updates during RL training (see Figure 1 below). This allows PipelineRL to achieve constantly high inference throughput and minimize the lag between the weights used for rollouts and the most recently updated model we...
