The best thing about agent skills is upskilling your agents on hard problems. There are two ways to look at that:
This blog post walks through the process of using a new tool, upskill, to generate and evaluate agent skills with large models and use them with smaller models. We will benchmark upskill on the task of writing CUDA kernels for diffusers models, but the process is generally useful for cutting costs, or using smaller models on hard and domain-specific problems.
In case you missed it, a...
