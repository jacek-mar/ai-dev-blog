            <description>The best thing about agent skills is upskilling your agents on hard problems. There are two ways to look at that: This blog post walks through the process of using a new tool, upskill, to generate and evaluate agent skills with large models and use them with smaller models.</description>

            <description>Shantanu Vishwanadha Published: January 21, 2026 · Last updated: January 21, 2026 Iteration one feels like magic. You describe a feature, the model delivers something believable, and you think: &quot;We&apos;re so back.&quot; Iteration two is usually fine. A tweak here, an edge case there. The model changes unrelated files. The diff becomes impossible to review.</description>

Developers were hungry to put the model to the test, using it across modes and tasks in Kilo. Overall, Kilo Coders loved the model. But there were also some unexpected findings in terms of speed, cost, and performance.</description>

            <description>TL;DR: Daggr is a new, open-source Python library for building AI workflows that connect Gradio apps, ML models, and custom functions. It automatically generates a visual canvas where you can inspect intermediate outputs, rerun individual steps, and manage state for complex pipelines, all in a few lines of Python code!</description>

            <description>Open Responses is a new and open inference standard. Initiated by OpenAI, built by the open source AI community, and backed by the Hugging Face ecosystem, Open Responses is based on the Responses API and is designed for the future of Agents. In this blog post, we’ll look at how Open Responses works and why the open source community should use Open Responses.</description>

            <description>AI agents often perform impressively in controlled research settings, yet struggle when deployed in real-world systems where they must reason across multiple steps, interact with real tools and APIs, operate under partial information, and recover from errors in stateful, permissioned environments—highlighting a persistent gap between research success and production reliability.</description>

Opus 4.6 represents Anthropic’s most significant leap in agentic capabilities to date—and it’s already live in Kilo for all users. You can even use your Kilo Pass credits to take advantage of the new Opus at a discount.</description>

Instead of juggling YAML files and terminals, you compose flows directly on the canvas, preview datasets before committing, tune prompts with inline variable hints, and watch executions stream live—all from a single pane.</description>

            <description>SOTA AI coding models have come a long way in the past year. They’re more powerful than ever —but using them often means thinking about caps, quotas, and trade-offs. Enter the world of open weight-coding models. MiniMax is the company behind one of the most capable open-weight models on the planet (MiniMax M2.1), and it’s great for developers who care about shipping code without friction.</description>

            <description>I interview a lot of engineers for Kilo, and something they always want to know is why and how engineers at Kilo own a whole product area. At most companies, this would be the job of at least 2-3 people, so how can one engineer do it all? Most engineering orgs assign engineers to a codebase. Ship features, close tickets, repeat.</description>

            <description>There’s a pattern with many vibe-coding tools. You describe something, it looks amazing for about five minutes, and then you try to do anything real with it and the whole thing falls apart. You export the code, stare at a folder structure you didn’t write, and realize you’re basically starting over. Kilo’s App Builder was built to break that pattern.</description>

This isn’t a futuristic concept demo anymore.</description>

            <description>A director at a traditional company recently told Gergely Orosz something that stuck with me: “We’re starting to rename 2-pizza teams to 1-pizza teams. With AI, large teams just no longer make sense and slows things down.” Amazon’s two-pizza rule has been engineering gospel for what, 20 years? If you need more than two pizzas to feed the team, the team is too big. Coordination costs eat you alive.</description>

            <description>On February 6, 2026, we’ll release the source code for Kilo Gateway and our Cloud backend infrastructure on GitHub under our Kilo-Org. This has been part of our roadmap from the beginning, and we’re six days away from shipping it. Most AI coding platforms operate as black boxes. You send a prompt, get code back, and everything in between stays hidden.</description>

            <description>When we first launched Kiro, we made a deliberate decision that frustrated some early users: we didnât include an ârun all tasksâ button. You had to check in with the agent after every task. âWhy canât I just run all the tasks in my spec at once?â was one of the top questions we got after launching 6 months ago. The request made senseâspecs often contain 5, 10, sometimes 20+ tasks.</description>

            <description>Early coding agents had this problem: AI generates code that looks correct, but IDE errors aren&apos;t immediately visible to the agent. This was because agents lacked visibility into these errors without executing additional tools. Consequently, the agent would move on confidently while the codebase accumulated technical debt.</description>

            <description>Leon Malisov Published: January 30, 2026 · Last updated: January 30, 2026 Model selection is more fluid than it used to be. Developers who work with LLMs tend to revisit their choices frequently, sometimes weekly, as new releases shift the decision and as different tasks reveal different model strengths.</description>

            <description>Everyone’s excited about OpenClaw. The security implications are real. People are buying Mac minis to run it, giving an autonomous agent unfiltered access to their accounts, SSH keys, passwords — their whole life. OpenClaw’s value does come from accessing your email, calendar, and messages. But I think you can get most of the value without handing over the keys to your life.</description>
