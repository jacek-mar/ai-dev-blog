            <description>Developer Relations Engineer I live through the same story with every single AI agent. After weeks of experiments and tests, it works like a charm. Suddenly, someone comes with a question that the agent fails to answer properly. I rush to make a change by tweaking one of the prompts. After a handful</description>

You generate code, maybe ask the AI to write some tests, and hope for the best. Zenflow does something different: it makes testing a non-negotiable part of eve</description>

            <description>The code compiles, the tests are green, everyone moves on. But what if that âpassingâ task took 17 turns because the agent couldnât find a file that was right there? What if it burned through retries on a shell command pattern that was never going to work? Benchmarks donât catch this. Pass/f</description>

            <description>Nearly every snowboard trick carries a number. A 1080 means three full rotations.

It refactors three helper functions, adds defensive null checks, and writes dozens of new tests for edge cases that were already passing. Even worse, it changes parts of the application that were working just fine. You wanted </description>
