            <description>Over the past few years, scaling dense language models has driven most progress in LLMs. From early models like the original ULMFiT (~30M parameters) or GPT-2 (1.5B parameters, which at the time was considered &quot;too dangerous to release&quot; 🧌), and eventually to today’s hundred-billion–parameter systems</description>

            <description>GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.5 are two new open-weight models now available in Kilo Code. MiniMax M2.5 scores 80.2% and GLM-5 scores 77.8% on SWE-bench Verified, putting them very close to GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 at a fraction of the cost. We ran both through three coding tasks in Kilo CLI, where they w</description>

            <description>Every SaaS platform you use is shipping an AI agent add-on right now. Your project management platform probably just announced one last week. And if your experience is anything like ours, they mostly don’t work. We spent four weeks trialing the AI agent add-on from our support ticketing platform.</description>

            <description>Nearly every snowboard trick carries a number. A 1080 means three full rotations. The convention is simple: add up every rotation around every axis and count in 180° increments. For decades it&apos;s served as the sport&apos;s universal shorthand for difficulty. Judges, coaches, and athletes all speak this la</description>

            <description>AI は日本の経済成長における新たな章を描く可能性を秘めており、その技術によって 100 兆円 (6,500 億米ドル) を超える経済価値が創出されると予測されています。しかし、その巨大なポテンシャルを実現できるかどうかは、多くのAIプロジェクトに決定的に欠けている“ある1つの要素”にかかっています。それは、実務で「使える学習データ」です。 この課題は、日本語と日本文化を理解する AI システムを構築する開発者にとって特に深刻です。英語の学習データは豊富にある一方で、日本の開発者は慢性的なデータ不足という問題に直面しています。高性能なモデルを初期段階から立ち上げるための、タスクに特化し、かつ日</description>

            <description>Hereâs a pattern most teams run into: you ask an AI agent to fix a bug. It refactors three helper functions, adds defensive null checks, and writes dozens of new tests for edge cases that were already passing. Even worse, it changes parts of the application that were working just fine. You wanted </description>
