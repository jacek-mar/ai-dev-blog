            <description>The best thing about agent skills is upskilling your agents on hard problems. There are two ways to look at that:
This blog post walks through the process of using a new tool, upskill, to generate and evaluate agent skills with large models and use them with smaller models. We will benchmark upskill on the task of writing CUDA kernels for diffusers models, but the process is generally useful for cutting costs, or using smaller models on hard and domain-specific problems.

Iteration one feels like magic. You describe a feature, the model delivers something believable, and you think: &quot;We&apos;re so back.&quot;
Iteration two is usually fine. A tweak here, an edge case there.
Then iteration three hits.
The model changes unrelated files.</description>

Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, with hundreds of millions of speakers across more than twenty countries. Despite this global reach, Arabic is not a monolithic language. Modern Standard Arabic coexists with a rich landscape of regional dialects that differ significantly in vocabulary, syntax, phonology, and cultural grounding.</description>

            <description>Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) extends traditional LLM training by optimizing not just a single-turn response, but an entire decision-making process learned through direct interaction with an environment during training. Unlike traditional single-turn reinforcement learning or offline preference-based methods that rely on static datasets, agentic RL trains policies by actively collecting on-policy data as the agent plans actions, invokes tools, observes outcomes, and adapts its behavior ove</description>

As the use of AI continues to grow, it’s becoming clear that not all AI systems are designed to function the same way. While agentic AI and generative AI are often grouped together, they serve very different purposes. From the way they operate to their decision-making processes, these two approaches reflect fundamentally different AI capabilities.</description>

            <description>Welcome back! This is the second part of our series on training efficient text-to-image models from scratch.
In the first post of this series, we introduced our goal: training a competitive text-to-image foundation model entirely from scratch, in the open, and at scale. We focused primarily on architectural choices and motivated the core design decisions behind our model PRX.
We also released an early, small (1.2B parameters) version of the model as a preview of what we are building (go try it i</description>

            <description>TL;DR: Daggr is a new, open-source Python library for building AI workflows that connect Gradio apps, ML models, and custom functions. It automatically generates a visual canvas where you can inspect intermediate outputs, rerun individual steps, and manage state for complex pipelines, all in a few lines of Python code!
If you&apos;ve built AI applications that combine multiple models or processing steps, you know the pain: chaining API calls, debugging pipelines, and losing track of intermediate</description>

            <description>Open Responses is a new and open inference standard. Initiated by OpenAI, built by the open source AI community, and backed by the Hugging Face ecosystem, Open Responses is based on the Responses API and is designed for the future of Agents. In this blog post, we’ll look at how Open Responses works and why the open source community should use Open Responses.
The era of the chatbot is long gone, and agents dominate inference workloads.</description>

            <description>We started Kilo Code with a simple mission: give every developer the world’s most powerful tools without the “frontier tax.” Today, we’re taking our biggest leap yet.
We are thrilled to announce that MiniMax’s hotly anticipated new model, MiniMax M2.5 is live on Kilo Code.
Not only is this a breathtaking new model from a top international lab, but we are making it completely free for all Kilo users for the first week.
Remember when we made M2.1 free for Kilo for Slack?
This is bigger.

In Part 1, we built an automated gate for scanning public repos before cloning them. In Part 2, we audited a real tool and discovered the structural vulnerability that affects every AI agent reading untrusted content.

Under the hood it’s the same platform, so everything you do visually generates the corresponding SyGra compatible graph config and task executor scri</description>

            <description>There’s a pattern with many vibe-coding tools. You describe something, it looks amazing for about five minutes, and then you try to do anything real with it and the whole thing falls apart. You export the code, stare at a folder structure you didn’t write, and realize you’re basically starting over.
Kilo’s App Builder was built to break that pattern.</description>

Amazon’s two-pizza rule has been engineering gospel for what, 20 years? If you need more than two pizzas to feed the team, the team is too big. Coordination costs eat you alive.</description>

We beg to differ.

            <description>On February 6, 2026, we’ll release the source code for Kilo Gateway and our Cloud backend infrastructure on GitHub under our Kilo-Org. This has been part of our roadmap from the beginning, and we’re six days away from shipping it.
Most AI coding platforms operate as black boxes. You send a prompt, get code back, and everything in between stays hidden.</description>

Model selection is more fluid than it used to be. Developers who work with LLMs tend to revisit their choices frequently, sometimes weekly, as new releases shift the decision and as different tasks reveal different model strengths. The process involves some combination of reading benchmarks, testing against real workflows, following what peers are using, and developing intuitions through direct experience.</description>

            <description>Everyone’s excited about OpenClaw. The security implications are real. People are buying Mac minis to run it, giving an autonomous agent unfiltered access to their accounts, SSH keys, passwords — their whole life.
OpenClaw’s value does come from accessing your email, calendar, and messages.</description>

            <description>Did you know: NVIDIA has a generous free tier that allows you to use models like Kimi K2.5 at no cost.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to use NVIDIA’s Build platform + Kilo Code to get free access to Kimi K2.5.
Install the Kilo Code extension
Sign up for an NVIDIA Build account.
If you don’t see a “Sign Up” screen, click “Sign In,” enter your email address, and the platform will automatically redirect you to a “Create Your Account” page..
After signing up, you’ll need to verify your pho</description>

            <description>tl;dr: We built an agent skill that teaches coding agents how to write production CUDA kernels. Then we pointed Claude and Codex at two real targets: a diffusers pipeline and a transformers model. The agents produced working kernels for both, with correct PyTorch bindings and benchmarks, end to end.
Writing CUDA kernels is hard.</description>

            <description>We’re excited to announce a powerful new stealth model from one of our most popular lab partners—and it’s totally free to use in Kilo Code. They’re calling it Pony Alpha, and it’s available wherever you use Kilo.
It feel like large language models (LLMs) have come further in the past two weeks than in the past two years. And Pony Alpha, a new 200k context model, is a part of that evolution.
As the model landscape heats up, one thing is certain: speed is a big part of the trifecta of cost, speed,</description>

Software engineering is becoming the first domain where artificial intelligence is not just an assistive technology, but a structural force. While debates continue around transparency, trust, and environmental cost, one pattern is already clear across industries: AI adoption is moving fastest and deepest inside software delivery itself.
This is not simply because developers are early adopters.</description>
